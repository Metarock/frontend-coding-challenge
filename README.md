# iTICKET Technical Challenge

This repo contains all the info you need to complete the iTICKET Technical Challenge.

We will provide you with User Stories and an API which you will need to turn into a frontend app.

Please treat this as a real life project. eg use git version control, tests and some basic documentation.

We are here to help during this process. You can ask us questions, get clarification and ask for advice. We encourage communication. A lot of this process is designed to see how you work and how you interact with us, so don't worry too much if it feels like a huge amount of work.

## Stage 1: Planning

Use the user stories below to come up with some project requirements.

Draw some wireframes (back of hte napkin sketches are fine) showing the pages you intend to create and the functionality on each.

We will then discuss what you have come up with and make sure it's in the scope of the challenge then continue with stage two.
